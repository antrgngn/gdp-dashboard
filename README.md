# About Us

We are a group of three Minerva University undergraduate students (An Nguyen, Tim Podkopayev, and Koosha Azim)  interested in wealth inequality and other economic phenomena impacting our global lives. We created this interactive tool to apply what we learned about measuring inequality in our IL181.008 - Quantitative Analysis Of Income, Inequality, And Intergenerational Mobility class.

# About this project

## Project Overview
An interactive data visualization tool that maps homeownership inequality across U.S. states from 1978 to 2023
Uses color-coded choropleth maps to show disparities between income groups in different regions
Allows users to explore both absolute ownership rates and relative inequality ratios
## Key Objectives
Make complex wealth inequality data accessible and understandable through visual storytelling
Track how homeownership gaps have evolved over time across different states
Compare ownership rates between top 10% and bottom 40% income groups to reveal economic disparities
Enable data-driven conversations about housing inequality in America
## Features
Interactive year selection spanning five decades
Multiple metrics including total ownership rates and income-group specific rates
Dual visualization showing both rates and ratios
State-by-state comparison capabilities
Consistent color scales for easy comparison across years
## Expected Impact
Support evidence-based policy discussions around housing inequality
Help researchers identify patterns and trends in homeownership disparities
Enable community organizations to better understand local housing challenges
Raise public awareness about wealth gaps through accessible data visualization
Provide educators with a tool to teach about economic inequality
## Data Sources






# Who is this for?

The tool would be valuable for policy researchers, students, community organizers, and concerned citizens who want to explore how homeownership rates vary across different income groups and states over time. Its user-friendly interface, with simple dropdown menus and slider controls, makes complex inequality data accessible to people without technical backgrounds, while still providing enough depth through multiple metrics (ownership rates and ratios) to be useful for some basic academic or policy analysis. The visualization of ownership disparities between top 10% and bottom 40% income groups helps illustrate wealth gaps in a tangible way that could inform public discourse and policy discussions about economic inequality in America.
